1. need a split button
2. when split button is pushed another player hand is made
    - one card stays in first player hand
    - other card is placed in second player hand
    
3. a card gets drawn out of deck and placed in second hand
4. a card gets drawn and placed in first hand
5. add a condition to the drawing that if (!secondhand) it draws the player cards like normal 
                                        if (secondhand) it makes the cards smaller and places them next to each other

6. second hand is placed on the right and played to completion first.
